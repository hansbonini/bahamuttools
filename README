This package contains the source materials (code/art/script) for the English
translation project for the Mega Drive game Bahamut Senki.

                    *          Build Instructions          *
                    ****************************************
                    
The build system is only set up for Unix-like systems, though none of the code
is fundamentally dependent on this and could be ported with a bit of effort.
You'll need GCC and libpng.

You'll first need a ROM image of Bahamut Senki for the Mega Drive. It
should match the following specifications:

  No-Intro filename: Bahamut Senki (Japan).md
  CRC32:             B1E268DA
  MD5:               E67C277CC6CBC821C3E0C1898A635DAF
  SHA-1:             CEE49B613298E060D938DE523DFCBB27E790B5AF

Rename it "bahamut.md" and place it in the "bahamut" folder. Then:

$ cd bahamut
$ ./build.sh

build.sh should then build all the necessary tools and output the translated
ROM as bahamut_en.md.

If you want to modify the project, check build.sh to see where the resources
that get inserted into the game are coming from.

See COPYING. Basically, everything by me (Supper) is GPLv3, and everything else
is under the terms of whoever wrote it.
