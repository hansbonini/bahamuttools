[10:20 AM] TheMajinZenki: while looking stuff up, this big ending I'm writing is apparently the "true" ending
[10:20 AM] TheMajinZenki: so the other characters probably don't have all of this
[10:21 AM] cccmar: So I'm guessing it depends on the scenario you pick, then, and how you play through it? This is actually kinda confusing.
[10:22 AM] TheMajinZenki: I think anything else gets a more generic ending
[10:22 AM] TheMajinZenki: the requirements for the true ending are very specific
[10:23 AM] TheMajinZenki: pick scenario "Bloodthirsty Bahamut"
[10:23 AM] TheMajinZenki: choose Sieg as Master
[10:23 AM] TheMajinZenki: while Balmer, Klimt and Vastral are still undefeated, reach turn 15
[10:24 AM] TheMajinZenki: that triggers the event where Raymond goes to kill Balmer alone
[10:24 AM] cccmar: Oh, I see... so it's that kind of deal. That's really specific.
[10:24 AM] TheMajinZenki: then you have to reach turn 40
[10:24 AM] TheMajinZenki: long story short, you have to keep Vastral as the last enemy to defeat
[10:25 AM] cccmar: You would probably never know this without a guide, lol. Maybe there are some hints in the manual, but I'm guessing it's one of those 'guidebook' games.
[10:25 AM] TheMajinZenki: this website says that you can kiiiinda figure it out by some hints
[10:26 AM] TheMajinZenki: but let's be honest, it's one of those things made so you have to buy the guide
[10:26 AM] TheMajinZenki: this is a Japanese game after all
[10:27 AM] TheMajinZenki: https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%83%90%E3%83%8F%E3%83%A0%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E6%88%A6%E8%A8%98%E5%85%AC%E5%BC%8F%E3%82%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%89%E3%83%96%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF-%E3%83%86%E3%83%AC%E3%83%93%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%83%89%E3%82%8F%E3%82%93%E3%81%B1%E3%81%A3%E3%81%8F-128/dp/4197410409
[10:27 AM] TheMajinZenki: you can still buy it from Amazon Japan
[10:27 AM] TheMajinZenki: as an aside, this is probably the official English title https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51cdojXXcvL.jpg
[10:27 AM] TheMajinZenki: Record of Bahamut War
